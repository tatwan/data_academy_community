# Game Sales

Looking into a product's sales within a region and comparing it to that product's sales worldwide is a great way to determine how important a region is to a company. In this activity, you will pair up with one of your classmates in order to create a series of scatter plots which will compare video game sales across regions.

## Instructions

* Create a scatter plot that compares the NA (North American) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

* Create a scatter plot that compares the EU (European) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

* Create a scatter plot that compares the JP (Japanese) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

* Create a scatter plot that compares other sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

* Go back into each of your charts and modify the value range between each axes so that they are consistent for each chart.

  * We want each axis to match to ensure the data is conveyed in a truthful manner.
