# Cereal Outliers

In this activity, you will be investigating data from a dataset called [80 Cereals](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/1993.expo/). Your task is to search through the ratings of each product and determine if there are any potential outliers in the dataset.

## Instructions

* Open up the activity workbook [Unsolved/Outliers_Activity_Unsolved.xlsx](Unsolved/Outliers_Activity_Unsolved.xlsx), and familiarize yourself with the raw data.

* Create a new worksheet, and name it "Outlier Testing".

* In the "Outlier Testing" worksheet, create a summary statistics table of the `rating` for the following statistics:

  * Mean

  * Median

  * Minimum value

  * Maximum value

  * First quartile

  * Third quartile

  * Interquartile Range

* Using the calculations from the table, determine the lower and upper boundaries of the `1.5*IQR` rule.

* Determine if there are any products whose `rating` falls outside of the `1.5*IQR` boundaries. List those products and their rating on the worksheet.

* Create a box plot of the `rating` for all products.

  * **Note**: Be sure to add a title and label your _y_-axis.
