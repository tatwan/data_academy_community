# Line and Bar Grades

For this activity, you’ll take on the role of the teacher as you create bar and line graphs to visualize your class’s grades over a semester.

## Instructions

* Create a series of bar graphs that visualize the grades of all students in the class, with one graph for every month.

* Create a line graph using all available data to compare students' grades over the semester.

  * Use filtering in the line graph to drill down to an individual student’s performance.


## Hint

When duplicating bar graphs, it helps to get the formatting and style of the chart where you want it for the first graph (that is, for January). Then, copy that chart, and re-select data for each subsequent copy. So, keep the style and format, and change the data included.
