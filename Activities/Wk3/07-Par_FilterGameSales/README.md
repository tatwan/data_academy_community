# Filtering Game Sales

Now that we know how to apply filters to a spreadsheet and create charts based on filtered data sets, we'll take some time to create charts that compare the sales of publishers against one another.

## Instructions

* Create a scatter plot that graphs the critical response (Critic Score) of games published by Nintendo as compared to their global sales.

  * Only chart those games that have been reviewed. Games without any reviews should be ignored.

  * Add a chart title, axis titles, and a trend line to the graph that is created.

  * Copy your chart and paste it into an external program -- paint, Microsoft Word, etc -- before moving onto making the next chart.

* Create a scatter plot that graphs the critical response of games published by Electronic Arts as compared to their global sales.

  * Only chart those games that have been reviewed. Games without any reviews should be ignored.

  * Add a chart title, axis titles, and a trend line to the graph that is created.

  * Copy your chart and paste it into an external program -- paint, Microsoft Word, etc -- before moving onto making the next chart.

* Select all of the data on the worksheet to create a Pivot Chart that can be filtered by publisher, whose rows are set by a game's year of release, and whose values are the sum of global sales for that year.

  * Create a 2D line graph that charts this data.
