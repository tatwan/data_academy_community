# Top-Songs Pivot Table

Pivot tables are exceptionally helpful when dealing with large-scale datasets that contain similarities between data points. For this activity, you will take a 5000-row spreadsheet containing data on the top-5000 songs from 1901 to today, and youâ€™ll use pivot tables to figure out the artists with the most songs in the top 5000, what those songs are, and what year they came out.

## Instructions

* Select all of the data within your worksheet, and then create a new pivot table.

* Make a pivot table that can be filtered by 'year' and contains two rows: 'artist' and 'name'.

  * All of an artist's songs should be listed underneath their name.

* Update your pivot table to contain values for:

  * How many songs an artist has in the top 5000.
  * The sum of the final_score of their songs.

* Sort your pivot table by descending sum of the final_score.
