# Transaction Analysis

After you finished your analysis using the Inventory data set, you learned that there is another data set named `tutorial.excel_sql_transaction_data` which contains all transactions (sales) by product. 



Here is the schema (table structure) for the Transaction dataset:

And here is the schema to the first data set you played with, the Inventory dataset:

You can inspect the new data sets with 

```sql
-- Returns first 100 rows from tutorial.excel_sql_transaction_data
  SELECT * FROM tutorial.excel_sql_transaction_data LIMIT 100;
```



### Q1 - If you are to relate/join the two tables, then which columns would you use from each table?



### Q2 - Start by counting number of records from each table



`tutorial.excel_sql_transaction_data` total records =  ? 

```sql
-- Write your query

```



`tutorial.excel_sql_inventory_data` total records = ?

```sql
-- Write you query

```



Did you match the following numbers?

What does the number of transactions represents? 

What additional information or insight can you make with this metric?
