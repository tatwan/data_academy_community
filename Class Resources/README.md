# Learning SQL

## SQL IDE/GUI 

**Installing a GUI (Graphical User Interface) or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**

When you install a SQL database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or others the most common way to interact with these database is through the terminal (or command line). Alternatively, for a more user friendly experience it is common to see SQL developers utilize an IDE (GUI based).  Here is a list of popular IDEs that you **can install and use for free**:

* **DBeaver** (recommended)
  * **Download**: To download the free community edition you can visit this link https://dbeaver.io/download/
  * Easy to use and supports many different databases whether cloud based or on-premise 
  * Easy to learn
  * Supports different OS including MacOS, Windows, and Linux

* **pgAdmin**
  * **Download**: https://www.pgadmin.org
  * Supports different OS including MacOS, Windows, as well as a Docker container for cross-platform 
  * Primarily designed to an interface for **PostgreSQL** unlike DBeaver which supports multiple databases 
* **MySQL Workbench**
  * **Download**: https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
  * Supports different OS including MacOS, Windows, and Linux 
  * Supports multiple databases unlike pgAdmin. DBeaver offers a more modern and intuitive design overall

# Installing a SQL Database

## Option A: Install a local database like PostgreSQL 

* To install PostgreSQL locally on your machine you can just go to PostgreSQL download page [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and select the appropriate OS: Linux, MacOS, Windows ..etc
* For Window OS you can opt to use the Interactive Installer 

![image-20240127163532050](images/image-20240127163532050.png)

* This should take you to the download page from EDB. Select the latest version

## Option D: Using SQLite

Another easy option to get started working with a SQL database is with SQLite. 

> SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. It is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process and reads and writes directly to ordinary **disk files**. It is widely used in various applications and is popular for its lightweight setup, minimal resource requirements, and cross-platform compatibility.

The easiest way to get started is via **DBeaver**

* Launch DBeaver and click on new connections

![image-20240127180944489](images/image-20240127180944489.png)

Select SQLite 

![image-20240127181004818](images/image-20240127181004818.png)

* Click Next

![image-20240127181026764](images/image-20240127181026764.png)

* Click on Create

![image-20240127181057990](images/image-20240127181057990.png)

* Give your database a name in the Save As option and chose where you want to the SQLite file (DB) saved

![image-20240127181119392](images/image-20240127181119392.png)

* Click Save

![image-20240127181146246](images/image-20240127181146246.png)

* Click Finish

And thatâ€™s it you know have a DB ready to use
