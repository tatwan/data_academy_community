### Capstone Project Option 2: Financial Data Analysis

> #### Overview
>
> This capstone project challenges you to apply your acquired skills in Excel, SQL, and Power BI to conduct a detailed analysis of a dataset within the financial data domain. Your goal is to unearth financial insights, trends, and patterns that could be valuable for investors, companies, or policy makers. Through this project, you will demonstrate your ability to transform raw data into a compelling financial story, supported by data-driven analysis.

#### Project Scope

1. **Data Selection**: Choose a dataset related to financial data. This can range from stock market data, cryptocurrency performance, company financial statements, to global economic indicators. Select a dataset that offers enough depth for a comprehensive analysis, and ensure it is manageable with the tools you have learned.
2. **Data Analysis Tools **(at least two):
   - **Excel**: Begin with Excel for preliminary data cleaning and exploration. Utilize functions such as VLookups, PivotTables, and financial formulas to structure your data and uncover initial insights.
   - **SQL**: Use SQL for handling more complex data queries, especially if your dataset is extensive or stored across multiple database tables. Focus on extracting specific financial metrics and performing joins to consolidate data from different sources.
   - **Power BI**: Create dynamic visualizations and dashboards in Power BI to illustrate your findings. Your visualizations should not only present data but also highlight financial trends, correlations, and potentially forecast future financial states.
3. **Analysis Focus Areas**:
   - **Market Trends Analysis**: Analyze trends within the market data you have selected. This might involve examining stock performance over time, identifying patterns in cryptocurrency volatility, or assessing sector-wise growth.
   - **Financial Health Assessment**: For datasets focused on company financials, conduct an analysis to assess financial health. This could include ratio analysis (e.g., liquidity, profitability, solvency ratios) and benchmarking against industry averages.
   - **Economic Indicators Review**: If focusing on economic data, evaluate how different indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation rates) correlate with market performance or impact financial markets.

#### Deliverables

1. **Report**: A comprehensive report that details your methodology, analysis, and insights. The report should be structured logically and include an introduction, data preparation steps, analysis findings, and conclusions. Appendices should contain relevant Excel and SQL snippets, and visualizations.
2. **Presentation**: A presentation designed to communicate your findings effectively to an audience. The presentation should engage listeners by telling the financial story discovered through your data analysis, emphasizing key insights and actionable recommendations.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore the data and insights you've uncovered. The dashboard should be intuitive, informative, and enable users to drill down into specific areas of interest.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on:

- **Data Preparation**: The effectiveness of your data cleaning and preparation process.
- **Analytical Rigor**: The depth and accuracy of your financial analysis.
- **Insight Quality**: The relevance and value of the financial insights provided.
- **Communication**: Your ability to convey complex financial data and insights clearly in both the report and presentation.
- **Visualization Excellence**: The usability, design, and informative nature of your Power BI dashboard.

#### Submission Guidelines

- Submit the final report and Power BI dashboard through the designated course portal.
- Presentation times will be allocated in the course's final week. Make sure your presentation is polished and ready for delivery.

We look forward to seeing the financial narratives you create through your analysis!
