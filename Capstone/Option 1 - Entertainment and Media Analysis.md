### Capstone Project Option 1: Entertainment and Media Analysis

> #### Overview
>
> In this capstone project, you will leverage your skills in Excel, SQL, and Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a dataset within the entertainment and media domain. Your objective is to tell a compelling story through data, highlighting trends, insights, and conclusions that are supported by your analysis. You will present your findings in a way that is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

#### Project Scope

1. **Data Selection**: Choose a dataset related to the entertainment and media industry. This could include data on movie box office earnings, streaming service viewership numbers, social media metrics of entertainment figures, or any other relevant dataset. Ensure the dataset is rich enough to allow for in-depth analysis but not so large that it cannot be managed with the tools at your disposal.
2. **Data Analysis Tools** (at least two):
   - **Excel**: Use Excel for initial data cleaning, exploration, and to perform analyses like VLookups and generating PivotTables. This step is crucial for understanding your dataset and preparing it for deeper analysis.
   - **SQL**: Utilize SQL for more sophisticated data querying, especially if your dataset is large or stored in a database. Focus on extracting specific insights and performing intermediate level queries that can help in segmenting the data in meaningful ways.
   - **Power BI**: Use Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards. Your dashboard should not only display the data but also tell a story by highlighting key insights and trends.
3. **Analysis Focus Areas**:
   - **Trend Analysis**: Identify and analyze trends over time within your dataset. For example, if you choose movie box office earnings, you might look at trends in genres, seasonal performance, or the impact of certain actors/directors.
   - **Comparative Analysis**: Compare different segments within your data. This could involve comparing the performance of different streaming services, the impact of social media presence on entertainment figures, or any other comparative metric relevant to your dataset.

#### Deliverables

1. **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation to showcase your findings. Your presentation should be engaging, clearly conveying the story your data tells, and highlighting the most interesting insights you have discovered. Aim for a balance between technical explanation and storytelling to keep your audience engaged.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: A Power BI dashboard that provides interactive visualizations of your key findings. The dashboard should be designed with the end-user in mind, making it easy for them to explore the data and uncover insights on their own.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be graded on the following criteria:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Efficiency and thoroughness in preparing your dataset for analysis.
- **Analysis Depth and Accuracy**: The complexity and correctness of your analysis techniques.
- **Insightfulness**: The quality and relevance of the insights derived from your analysis.
- **Storytelling and Presentation**: How effectively you communicate your findings, both in written and presentation formats.
- **Visualization Quality**: The design, usability, and informativeness of your Power BI dashboard.

#### Submission Guidelines

- Presentations will be scheduled during the final week of the course. Ensure your presentation is ready and rehearsed by then.
