### Capstone Project Option 3: Economic Data Analysis

> #### Overview
>
> This capstone project invites you to apply the Excel, SQL, and Power BI skills you've developed to perform an in-depth analysis of economic data. Your mission is to extract meaningful insights from economic indicators, demographic statistics, or trade data to tell a story about economic conditions, trends, and their implications. This project is your opportunity to demonstrate how data analysis can illuminate understanding of economic phenomena and inform decision-making.

#### Project Scope

1. **Data Selection**: Select a dataset that encompasses economic data. This could include, but is not limited to, datasets on unemployment rates, inflation figures, demographic changes, trade balances, or GDP growth across different countries or regions. Choose a dataset that is both challenging and feasible to manage with the tools you've learned.
2. **Data Analysis Tools** (at least two):
   - **Excel**: Use Excel for initial data cleaning and exploration. Employ advanced Excel features such as VLookups, PivotTables, and various analytical functions to prepare your data and identify preliminary insights.
   - **SQL**: Leverage SQL for detailed data manipulation and analysis, especially if dealing with large datasets or requiring complex queries to merge and compare different data sources.
   - **Power BI**: Employ Power BI to craft interactive visualizations and dashboards. Your dashboards should effectively communicate economic trends and insights, allowing users to explore the underlying data.
3. **Analysis Focus Areas**:
   - **Trend Analysis**: Investigate long-term economic trends. Analyze how certain economic indicators have changed over time and what these changes suggest about economic health and development.
   - **Comparative Analysis**: Compare economic indicators across different countries, regions, or time periods. Highlight disparities, growth patterns, and potential causes or effects of these differences.
   - **Impact Analysis**: Explore the impact of significant economic events, policies, or interventions. This could involve assessing the economic effects of a trade agreement, a monetary policy shift, or the economic repercussions of demographic changes.

#### Deliverables

1. **Presentation**: A polished presentation designed to share your economic analysis insights with an audience. Your presentation should effectively bridge technical analysis and storytelling, making complex economic data accessible and engaging.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive Power BI dashboard that showcases your main findings and allows users to delve into the data. The dashboard should be user-friendly, informative, and enable exploration of different economic scenarios or hypotheses.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated on the following aspects:

- **Data Preparation Excellence**: Effectiveness in cleaning and preparing the economic data for analysis.
- **Analytical Depth**: The complexity and thoroughness of your economic analysis.
- **Insight Generation**: The relevance and originality of the insights uncovered through your analysis.
- **Storytelling and Communication Skills**: Your ability to present economic data and insights in a clear, compelling manner.
- **Visualization and Interactivity**: The design and functionality of your Power BI dashboard, including its ability to engage and inform users.

#### Submission Guidelines

- Presentation sessions will be scheduled in the last week of the course. Ensure your presentation is well-prepared and rehearsed.

This project is your chance to showcase the power of data analysis in understanding and interpreting economic trends and phenomena. We eagerly anticipate the economic stories you will tell through your analyses!
