### Capstone Project Option 4: Sales Data Analysis

> #### Overview
>
> For this capstone project, you will apply your skills in Excel, SQL, and Power BI to conduct a thorough analysis of sales data. This project aims to uncover sales trends, performance metrics, and actionable insights that could help a hypothetical company optimize its sales strategies, improve performance, and increase profitability. By analyzing sales data, you will demonstrate how to leverage data analysis tools to support business decision-making.

#### Project Scope

1. **Data Selection**: Choose a dataset that represents sales data. This could be a dataset from a retail company, online sales data, or any other sales-related dataset that includes variables such as sales figures, product categories, geographical locations, time (monthly, quarterly, yearly sales), and customer segments. Ensure the dataset is comprehensive enough to allow a detailed analysis.
2. **Data Analysis Tools** (at least two):
   - **Excel**: Use Excel for initial data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration. Utilize functionalities like VLookups, PivotTables, and various analytical formulas to understand the basic patterns and prepare the dataset for deeper analysis.
   - **SQL**: Employ SQL for advanced data querying and manipulation, especially useful for handling larger datasets or combining multiple data sources. Focus on writing queries that can extract specific insights, such as sales performance by region or product category.
   - **Power BI**: Utilize Power BI to create dynamic visualizations and dashboards. Your dashboard should not only present the data effectively but also highlight key sales trends, compare performance across different segments, and potentially identify opportunities for growth.
3. **Analysis Focus Areas**:
   - **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate sales performance across different dimensions such as time periods, geographical regions, product categories, and customer segments. Identify top-performing areas as well as underperforming ones.
   - **Trend Analysis**: Analyze sales trends over time to identify patterns, seasonal variations, or any cyclical changes in sales performance.

#### Deliverables

1. **Report**: A comprehensive report that details your analysis process, findings, and insights. The report should include a clear introduction, methodology, detailed analysis sections, and a conclusion with actionable recommendations. Appendices should contain screenshots of your Excel work, SQL queries, and visualizations from Power BI.
2. **Presentation**: A presentation that succinctly and effectively communicates your findings and recommendations to a hypothetical company's management team. The presentation should be engaging and visually appealing, making complex data understandable for decision-makers.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore the sales data and insights you have generated. The dashboard should be intuitive, informative, and tailored to the needs of business users, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the insights provided.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on:

- **Data Handling**: Your ability to clean, manipulate, and prepare the sales data for analysis.
- **Analytical Approach**: The depth and breadth of your analysis, including the use of various tools and techniques to uncover insights.
- **Insightfulness**: The quality and relevance of the insights and recommendations derived from your analysis.
- **Presentation Skills**: Your ability to effectively communicate your findings and insights, both in written format and during your presentation.
- **Visualization Impact**: The design, usability, and effectiveness of your Power BI dashboard in conveying key messages and insights.

#### Submission Guidelines

- Ensure your presentation is ready for the scheduled session in the final week of the course. Practice to ensure clarity and conciseness in your delivery.

This project provides a practical opportunity to showcase how data analysis can directly impact business strategy and outcomes. We look forward to seeing your innovative approaches to analyzing sales data and deriving meaningful insights.
